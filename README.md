A Grid Materialzed Stateful Deep Net is a deep net that
* Runs on a grid and can be quickly resized and reshaped
* includes a persistent and comprehensive dynamically resizable memory array for each node. 


Imagine for a moment that you have a library of deepnets. Depending on the task at hand, you can deploy, utilize, train, preserve, and tear down that deepnet in the space of a few milliseconds... fast enough to handle tasks as a service.

Imagine that on top of that, each deepnet can remember an unlimited number of trainings, and be reset to any particular training on demand.

Sound improbable? Impossible? It is not. And I will have it completed in under 5 years.

I've been writing programs since 1980. My very first programming exercise was to type in and run the Eliza program (in basic) out of a programming magazine. My second was a sprite animation of a stick figure running across the screen that I designed built and implemented all by myself. I was 10.

Prior to college I was doing 3d rotations in assembly language. Then I learned real programming.

I was published as an undergraduate. On the backend of that publication, I built a scripting engine for the WWW but lost out to more widely talked about scripting engine called PHP, which I have since avoided with extreme prejudice. 

Before graduation, I built a community of autonomous AI robots in LP, with a visual UI written in AWT. 

I also wrote a chat bot for a popular multiplayer RTS called bartender bot that served over 50000 drinks in chatrooms before lost interest and turned it off.

Out of college, I answered a newspaper ad and went to work for an information storage and retrieval company out of california. Most of my classmates landed at xerox or lockheed, for a lot less. I bubbled in and out of development orientated professional services gigs for most of the fortune 100 until eventually I landed a longer term security software development gig in San Antonio, and from there a large online retailler, and then 14 years later the legal tech industry. 

Along the way, I have visited 6 countries, spent over $1mm on hardware, prevented over $500mm in fraud, written software used daily by billions, achieved a national pistol ranking, started a band, toured, and now have an interest in the financial markets. I like throughput: early in my seattle career I  found a way to stream 50k messages/s over a single activemq connection. Later on, I accidentally DOS'd SNS (and took it down for over 15 minutes) with just 1 desktop computer.

The most interesting boomerang of my life is that the same counselor who kicked me out of summer camp in the early 80's ended up being my counselor again in 25 years later, and on the opposite coastline. The most challenging problem i ever solved was dynamic array resizing in log(n) using counted b+ trees. (Similar to using a numerical skip list, but tree based). The most interesting: an AI that could realtime classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous with 90% accuracy after 20 samples, and 98% at 100.
